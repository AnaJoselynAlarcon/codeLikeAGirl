# Code Like A Girl
Personal Resume

# Description
This is a landing page of a personal website that seeks to sell me as a developer in a very creative way. <br />
I created all the content and the design. <br />
It was made with HTML, CSS and JavaScript following all the best practices in the Udacity Guideline. <br />

# Highlights
- Dynamic desktop and mobile navbars. <br />
- Active classes acording to sections in viewport. <br />
- Navbar scrolls to the section clicked. <br />
- Mobile menu that also has active class and scroll while open. <br />
- Fun design. <br />
